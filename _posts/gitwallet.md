Today, we’re launching a new project for developers to launch & grow a business alongside an open source project. It’s called [**Gitwallet**](https://www.gitwallet.co).

We’re inspired to no end by people dedicated to sharing code permissively, inviting others to build on their work. This is a creative act and a blueprint for how innovation happens in technology. Now, more than 70% of a modern codebase is open source. It’s the fabric of all software and an essential public good.

Today, it’s easier than ever to share your code, build in teams and invite contributors. The real challenge starts when you want to build a community, and turn a successful project into something more. Serious projects are looking for more to help them with commerce, analytics and community growth.

How we use open source is changing rapidly. It’s easier than ever to set up and install a package to use, but the looming threat of security breaches, license changes, community health issues are growing concerns. Companies are looking for new ways to work with the ecosystems they depend on. 

Gitwallet is an exploration of these problem spaces. 

We believe serious open source teams need new tools - to help them build strong businesses and ecosystems around their projects. We believe in bringing together maintainers and the companies that depend on their software in new ways. And we don’t have to *believe* that the means of making software itself being transformed - that’s already happening in front of us. We’re entering a brave new world.

We’re launching our platform today with a simple premise - to help anyone build a business around an open source project. With Gitwallet, you can quickly

**Set up a commercial offering** tied to a GitHub project, like paid support, consulting or training.
**Promote your services** with customizable landing Pages & embeds.
**Understand how people are using your open source**, using new research and analytics tools.
**Manage & grow your customer base** with light CRM & reporting built in.

Over time, we hope to enable more projects to become successful businesses, and enable new types of relationships between open source teams and the companies that rely on them.
